    <h1>African Fish Roll (Fish Pie)</h1>
    <div>
        <p><strong>African Fish Roll (Fish pie)</strong> — a popular West African street food – specifically in Cameroon, Nigeria and Ghana that is made with some sort of shortcut pastry filled with sardines and spices. These fried fish pies are crunchy, slightly sweet, spicy and oh so good.it is rolled up, while in other countries it is made in the shape of meat pie (empanadas).</p>

      <p>It is really all the rage for adults and kids, who would hurriedly leave school, in an attempt to get a piece from the ladies selling it, at the entrance of the school. It is more convenient to buy from the street vendors than make it at home in Africa.

Maybe because it is looked down as “poor man’s” snack. Meat pies are the “rich man‘s version. Africans living abroad would classify it as a” MUST EAT” at parties – it flies off the table.

This version of fish pie is made with canned sardines in tomato chilli sauce , slowly simmered with onions and a little bit of curry until all the liquid has evaporated. Then the mixture is folded in the pastry and deep fried until golden brown.

It is somewhat tedious to make, but is worth it at the end.

            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Drain half of the tomato sauce from the mackerel and place in a medium sauce pan. Then add the onions, curry powder and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes until almost all the liquid has evaporated , add parsley . Stir and simmer for about 2 more minutes. Set aside and let it cool.
</li>
<li>In a large bowl add the warm water, and yeast. Set aside for 5 minutes
</li>
<li>
    Using a stand mixer or by hand, mix the flour, sugar, salt, then add margarine, mix well until the ingredients have been fully incorporated.
</li>
<li>
    Then add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture and mix for about a minute
</li>
<li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead it just until all the flour is incorporated and the dough is smooth
</li>
<li>Cover and let it sit for 30 to 45 minutes.

</li>
<li>Divide dough into 1 -2 ounce each- you will have about 25 -35 each depending on the weight</li>
<li>On a lightly floured work surface, using a rolling pin, roll out the each 2 ounce dough until ½” larger in diameter.

</li>
<li>Then place a teaspoon of fish mixture and roll it up. Repeat the process. Set aside the fish pie

</li>
<li>Heat up a large skillet or cast iron with oil up to ½ inch- medium-high heat (375) until hot but not smoking.

</li>
<li>Scoop up the batter with a spoon preferably and fry in batches, turning once, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Do not overcrowd the pan (it will absorb excess oil, resulting in a soggy fish pies)</li>
<li>
    Using a slotted spoon, remove the fish pie and place them on paper towels.
